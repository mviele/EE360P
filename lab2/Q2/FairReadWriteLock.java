//40 points) Implement a Java class FairReadWriteLock that synchronizes reader and writer threads using monitors with wait, notify and notifyAll methods. The class should provide the following methods: void beginRead(), void endRead(), void beginWrite(), and void endWrite(). A reader thread only invokes beginRead() and endRead() while a writer thread only invokes beginWrite() and endWrite(). In addition, the lock (instance of this class) should provide the following properties:
//1

//(a) There is no read-write or write-write conï¬‚ict.
//(b) A writer thread that invokes beginWrite() will be blocked until all preceding reader and writer threads have acquired and released the lock.
//(c) A reader thread that invokes beginRead() will be blocked until all preceding writer threads have acquired and released the lock.
//(d) A reader thread cannot be blocked if any preceding writer thread has acquired and released the lock.
//The precedence of threads is determined by the timestamp (sequence number) that threads obtain on arrival.
